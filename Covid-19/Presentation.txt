Iâ€™m excited to share with you the integral part of our 
COVID-19-Data-Engineering-and-Analysis-Project, Our flask application.
With the database ready and populated with the imported data.
We built a Flask web application that enables users to interact with the data intuitively. ( NEXT SLIDE )
Flask is a lightweight and flexible web framework in Python that 
allowed us to create a dynamic and interactive platform for users to explore and analyze our COVID-19 data.
Users can search for data by country, or view the results in a pandas DataFrame. 
Flask served as the backbone of our web application and enabled us to create dynamic routes that 
query the PostgreSQL database in real-time, providing users with relevant data. ( NEXT SLIDE )
The Flask application also includes a Restful API that outputs data in JSON format.
By integrating pandas, we were able to display the data in a user-friendly format, with visualizations
and with the help of the pyarrow library, 
we ensured that our data processing was both efficient and scalable.

Conclusion: 
In conclusion, our COVID-19 Data Search Application embodies effective data engineering practices, 
user-centric design, and ethical responsibility. It provides a reliable platform for exploring COVID-19 data, 
supporting informed decision-making and contributing to our understanding of data engineering.
